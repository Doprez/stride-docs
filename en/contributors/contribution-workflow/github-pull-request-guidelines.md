# GitHub Pull Request Guidelines

This guide assumes familiarity with the basics of Git and GitHub, focusing on providing instructions for creating pull requests (PRs) that are straightforward for the Stride team to review and merge.

For a suggested workflow on contributing to Stride, please check our [Contribution Workflow](index.md).

When submitting a pull request, you'll use a [template](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) that guides you through providing all the necessary details for a smooth review process. The template includes sections for a concise summary of your changes, a detailed description, any related issues, the motivation behind the changes, and the types of changes being proposed.

A crucial part of this template is the checklist, which includes verifying documentation needs, adding tests for new features, ensuring all tests pass, and notably, confirming that you have **built and run the editor** to test your changes personally. This step is especially important as it demonstrates due diligence in testing your contribution, significantly aiding the review process by ensuring functionality and reducing potential integration issues.

The template is structured to cover:
- **Summary**: A brief overview of the changes.
- **Description**: An in-depth explanation of what has been changed or added.
- **Related Issue**: Linking to discussions or bug reports related to the PR.
- **Motivation and Context**: The reasoning behind the changes.
- **Types of Changes**: Categorizing the nature of the changes.
- **Checklist**: A series of verification steps to ensure the PR is comprehensive and tested.

This systematic approach helps streamline the review process, making it easier for the Stride team to understand, review, and merge your contributions efficiently.
