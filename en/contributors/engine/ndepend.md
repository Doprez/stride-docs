# [WIP] Introduction to NDepend

[NDepend](https://www.ndepend.com/) is a powerful static analysis tool designed to provide comprehensive code quality insights, enforce coding standards, and identify potential flaws in software projects. In the context of the Stride game engine, NDepend helps maintain high code standards by analyzing dependencies, measuring code complexity, and offering detailed reports on various metrics.

By integrating NDepend into our development process, we gain valuable insights that enable us to optimize the architecture, improve code performance, and ensure maintainability. The tool provides:

- **Dependency Graphs and Matrix**: Visualize code organization and interdependencies within the engine.
- **Code Metrics**: Quantitative measures of code complexity which assist in identifying areas that may require refactoring.
- **Compliance to Coding Standards**: Ensures that the codebase adheres to defined coding standards, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and quality across the engine.
- **Code Quality Gates**: Define specific criteria that the code must meet before being deemed production-ready, enhancing the overall quality of the game engine.
