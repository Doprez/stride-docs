## A little help

We, contributors, believe that Stride can help .NET game developers make the games they want with ease using their favorite languages. We want to make sure Stride offers the most comfortable environment for developing games, and this takes time and effort.

Since the free and open-source release of Stride, the community has been growing slowly, so we have decided to open a fund to reward developers for any contribution they make to Stride. We set up an [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/stride3d) to manage our funds and allocate money for features that the community would like to see implemented.

We have various bounties for [bug fixes and features](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects) (Vulkan support, decals, morph targets, and many others). If you have or know someone with the skills to tackle those bounties, please reach out to us through the [respective GitHub tickets](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/bounty). You can also contact us through our discord server or on GitHub to propose new bounties.
